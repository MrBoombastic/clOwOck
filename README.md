Android app for displaying data from the Qingping CGD1 - Bluetooth LE alarm
clock with sensors.

## Warning

App was partially created using LLMs. I still have reviewed the code,
so it's only semi-slop, but you have been warned, etc., etc.

## Features

* Scans for a specific Bluetooth LE device by its MAC address.
* Parses and displays sensor data.
* Widget for displaying the latest sensor data on the home screen.
* Configurable background updates to fetch data periodically.
* Settings to customize the device's MAC address, theme (light/dark/system), and language.
* Initial setup screen to guide the user through finding and selecting their device.

## Technical Details

The application is built with modern Android development technologies and targets recent Android
versions.

* **Target API:** The application targets Android 15 (API level 36) and has a minimum requirement of
  Android 14 (API level 34).
* **UI:** Jetpack Compose for a declarative and modern UI.
* **Bluetooth LE:** It uses Android's native Bluetooth LE scanner to listen for advertisement
  packets from the sensor. It filters for devices advertising the specific service UUID
  `0000fdcd-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`.
* **Data Parsing:** The sensor data is extracted from the service data field of the advertisement
  packet. The custom data format is as follows:
    * Byte 1: Device ID (must be `0x0C` for CGD1)
    * Bytes 10-11: Temperature (16-bit Little Endian signed integer, divided by 10)
    * Bytes 12-13: Humidity (16-bit Little Endian unsigned integer, divided by 10)
    * Byte 16: Battery level (unsigned 8-bit integer)
* **Background Processing:** `WorkManager` and `AlarmManager` for scheduling periodic data fetches,
  ensuring the widget is always up-to-date.
